# MERCEDES-BENZ.IO SINFO CHALLENGE

Hello. My name is Gon√ßalo Ferreira and this is my proposal for the SINFO Challenge.

## Assumptions

1. Asssumed an article can have either a CTA button or an Image, and never both at the same time (as no design was specified fot this case);
2. Assumed "Section Title" is a mandatory field for creating an article (to be able display it on the navigation menus)
3. Assumed that if the image/cta checkbox are selected, imageURL/CTAText are mandatory
4. Assumed that an error message is shown on the form if mandatory fields are not filled

## Some technical details

1. To avoid using Document.createElement, a basic template system is at use. This means that I have templated in an hidden element all the elements that can be generated (articles and navigation entries). These elements are then cloned using Document.cloneNode(), which a quick and dirty search suggests to be faster (https://github.com/sophiebits/innerhtml-vs-createelement-vs-clonenode)
2. All the animations are powered by CSS, using transition.
